# MusicTheoryTrainer
A long term pet project, that will eventually drill students in key signatures, chords, scales, etc.

In its current form, there is only a key signature drill.

Planned features:
  * Student tracking (levels passed, XP, some game-like features)
  * Scale drills
  * Chord drills
  * Aural skills
